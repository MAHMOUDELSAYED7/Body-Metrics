# Body Metrics
Body Metrics is a user-friendly Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator application built using Flutter and managed with Riverpod for state management. The app provides an intuitive interface for users to calculate their BMI and understand their health status based on the BMI value. With support for multiple languages and customizable text styles, Body Metrics ensures a personalized experience for every user.

## Features

### BMI Calculation

Body Metrics calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your weight and height. BMI is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. The app provides the following functionalities:

- Input fields for `weight(kilograms)` and `height(centimeters)`.
- Instant calculation of BMI upon entering the required values.
- Clear display of the BMI result with a classification `(Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese)`.
- User-Friendly UI
The app is designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The clean layout ensures that users can quickly enter their details and view their BMI results without any hassle.

### Multi-Language Support
BodyMetrics supports `two languages`:

- **`Arabic`**
- **`English`**

Users can easily switch between languages from the settings menu, making the app accessible to a broader audience.

### Customizable Text Styles/Font Families
To enhance user experience, Body Metrics `offers three different font families`:

- **`Poppins:`** A modern and clean font family.
- **`GermaniaOne:`** A unique and eye-catching font family.
- **`MetalMania:`** A bold and dynamic font family.
  
Users can select their preferred text style from the settings menu.
